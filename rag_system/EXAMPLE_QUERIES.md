-- Search for "subscription"
SELECT chunk_content FROM prd_knowledge_base

SELECT chunk_content FROM prd_knowledge_base

LIMIT 5;

## üí° Tips for Better Results

### ‚úÖ DO:
- **Be specific**: Instead of "tell me about features", ask "What are the Careem Plus features for ride hailing?"
- **Mention context**: "In the Q4 vision document, what are the retention initiatives?"
- **Ask for lists**: "List all the success metrics mentioned"
- **Reference documents**: "According to the food trial results, what was the outcome?"

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Ask vague questions like "tell me everything"
- Use very short queries like "features?"
- Expect information not in your documents
- Ask multiple unrelated questions in one query

---

## üéØ Question Templates

Use these templates and customize them:

```sql
-- Feature inquiry
SELECT * FROM tidal 
WHERE question = 'What are the [FEATURE NAME] features in [DOCUMENT/AREA]?';

-- Technical details
SELECT * FROM tidal 
WHERE question = 'How does [FEATURE] work according to the documents?';

-- Comparison
SELECT * FROM tidal 
WHERE question = 'Compare [THING A] and [THING B] across the documents';

-- Timeline
SELECT * FROM tidal 
WHERE question = 'What is the timeline for [INITIATIVE/FEATURE]?';

-- Metrics
SELECT * FROM tidal 
WHERE question = 'What are the success metrics for [FEATURE/INITIATIVE]?';
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Agent returns "information not available"
- Try rephrasing your question
- Be more specific about what you're looking for
- Try searching the knowledge base directly first

### Query times out
- Simplify your question
- Ask one thing at a time instead of multiple questions
- Try again (sometimes it's just a temporary issue)

### Results don't match expectations
- The agent interprets based on what's in the documents
- Try direct knowledge base search to verify data is there
- Rephrase to be more specific
