Careem Plus: Experiences enhancement Food E2E
Last updated date 21.08.2024
Problem statement
In the Careem Food app, the current experience offers a generalized/non personalized view for all
customers (members vs non members). This lack of personalization is a strong constraint preventing
us from offering the most relevant and delightful experience on different stages of the customer
lifecycle.
Customer problem
Non members
- The existing widget at the bottom of the existing is easily missable and doesn’t give enough
context on what the subscription program is offering on Food
- The Careem Plus tag on restaurants might not be clearly understood by users
- Discoverability of exclusive offers through existing tiles is pretty low
- Users are not able to easily understand if the program would be valuable (break-even
scenarios for instance)
- A gap in experiences from SA home page to Checkout due mainly to the different type of
components and messaging we using across the journey
- Very low visibility of the exclusive offer on menu which a user could unlock on current order
by subscribing to the program
Members
- Users signing up to the program and visiting Food for the first time (or no food order yet - NU)
don’t understand the benefit have been activated and how the benefit applies (restaurants,
type of benefit)
- Discoverability of exclusive offers through tiles is pretty low and conversion is the lowest
amongst all tiles
- Users don’t understand how the offers, food or Careem Plus, should apply
- The current experience doesn’t allow us to make users feel premium enough on Food
- The priority support benefit, identified as a strong value proposition in past researches, is not
communicated within the Food journey
- Gratification is nonexistent through the journey Workshop being run with Careem Plus and Food team: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNo_jv6E=/
Business problem
Old stack dependencies: The live experiences relies on different infrastructures which are not
platformized, and increase the gap between newly developed experiences on SA home page for
instance. Such limitation don’t allow us to leverage tools such as Segment Builder which has allowed
successful tactics in the past for Careem Plus
Lack of configuration: There is a heavy dependency on engineering resources for any changes
happening on Food discovery and Menu
Engagement stagnating: The level of engagement on Food from members didn’t move much in last
few months, from 62.5% in January 2024 to 63.2% in April 2024 so far*

Strategic alignment
1. Strategy: Increase awareness of the program on the early stages of the Food journey for EU
and NU to boost acquisition on the latest stage of the funnel (checkout)
Enhance members engagement through personalized and relevant experiences, and hence
improve retention rate
2. Metric: Focus on key conversion and engagement metrics such as:
a. # Subscribers: Validating the increase in sign up on existing checkout experience by
improve awareness of the program in early stages
b. % Members using Food: Tracking how users will interact with new experiences and
how conversion is impacted (subset to be NU members conversion, and impact on
overall NU conversion)
c. Retention %: Understanding how engagement improvement on Food will impact
retention on the program (with a view per number of orders)
3. Tactic: Optimize the level of personalization in early stages of the Food journey and for
different segments of users. Double down on existing experiences (or soon to be launched
such as App engine) to run “cheap” tests and iterate faster
In later stage, we do believe earn addons/upgrade would be strong hook to boost engagement, and
convert newly converted users on Food into powered users (study will be run in May)
Careem Plus: Addons & Upgrade
Supporting observations
- Contextualised Tiles - EDA
- (see FY '23 Goals & Targets) Growth Dash Careem Plus
- We would need to get some extra data points following the workshop which we run
Hypotheses
By building more personalized and configurable experiences, users will have more delightful and
relevant experiences. This can result in higher acquisition, better engagement, and lead to a better
conversion on Food
Discovery - Summary of changes & Requirements
Careem Plus user
- When landing for the first time on Food after subscribing to Careem Plus, user should get an
onboarding experience to understand what are the benefits on Food
- Free delivery
- MOV AED 30 to unlock free delivery
- Exclusive offers
- In the onboarding, user should understand how to identify which merchants are part of
Careem plus benefit
- User should be able to understand easily average savings user is going to make based on
average member data (or social proof) or past behavior on Food (if EU)
Then post onboarding and in any food session in the future:
- User should easily understand which merchant offers free delivery benefit
- User should easily understand if there is an exclusive offer on a selected merchant
- User should be able to access all merchants offering exclusive offers
Non Careem Plus user
- When landing for the first time only on food, user should get an onboarding experience to
discover Food services and get to know about Careem Plus
Then post first session on Food and in any food session in the future
- User should easily understand which merchant offers free delivery benefit
- User should easily understand if there is an exclusive offer on a selected merchant
- User can see exclusive section locked and once clicking on it be redirected to Careem Plus sign
up page (or 1 click to add subscription to future basket)
- User should see a Careem Plus entrypoint to go to Careem Plus sign up page and subscribe
Subpages: Deepdive into Offers/Burgers subpages
The Food team is currently building a new concept on Food end: Subpages.
See more details here: PRD: SubPages
The first use cases being prioritized on this topic are Offers and Burgers.
See design: Food Subpages
As a Careem Plus team, we aim to leverage such new experiences to tackle some key customer
problems, which we shared in the first section above of the PRD.
Customer problem
- Non Members
- Discoverability of exclusive offers through existing tiles is pretty low
- Very low visibility of the exclusive which a user could unlock on current order by
subscribing to the program
- Members
- Discoverability of exclusive offers through tiles is pretty low and conversion is the
lowest amongst all tiles
Hypothesis Careem Plus members
- Surfacing better the exclusive offers and in a more relevant context will help increase
awareness and likelihood of ordering from those places
Hypothesis Non Careem Plus members
- Surfacing better the exclusive offers which can be unlocked and offering an entrypoint to sign
up to the program will increase number of subscribers
Design exploration Members
- Exploration 1: Leverage Offers subpages
- Switch off the Exclusive offer tile in Discovery home page
- Incorporate Careem Plus exclusive offers in the Current active offers and allow users
to discover all exclusive offers available through this entrypoint
- Exploration 2: Build a Careem Plus offers subpages
- Redirect users to the Careem Plus offers subpages from the tile in Discovery home
page, and the Current active offer in Offer Subpages
- Offer a unique subpage for Exclusive offers with different layers of context to increase
likelihood to order from those merchants
For instance, in my area (Satwa), Ihave a recommendation of 27 places under Exclusive offers
Cuisine Number of merchants
Italian 2
Cafe / Bakery 4
Asian 3
Lebanese 2
Healthy 3
Chicken/BBQ/Burger 3
Mexican 1
Indian 7
Burger 2
We could offer more context and different layers such as:
- Order from your favorites
- Order from members favorites (social proof)
- In the context of the time
- Promote Cafe/Bakery in the morning
- Promote Healthy for lunch
- Promote Indian / Lebanese / Asian at dinner time…
- …..
Design exploration Non Members
- Exploration 1: Leverage Offers subpages
- Switch off the Exclusive offer tile in Discovery home page
- Incorporate Careem Plus exclusive offers in the Current active offers and allow users
to discover all exclusive offers available through this entrypoint. We could enhance
the experience through a locking design which users can still click on. Then while
discovering all exclusive offers, user should be able to find an entrypoint to Careem
Plus sign up page
- Exploration 2: Build a Careem Plus offers subpages
- Redirect users to the Careem Plus offers subpages from the tile in Discovery home
page, and the Current active offer in Offer Subpages
- Offer a unique subpage for Exclusive offers with different layers of context to increase
likelihood to order from those merchants
- Use the header of Careem Plus offers subpages to redirect users to Careem Plus sign
up page
Menu - Summary of changes & Requirements
Subscribed user
- User should be able to understand there is a free delivery benefit with a merchant
- User should be able to understand what the MOV to avail free delivery with a merchant
- User should know if MOV is reached while adding items to basket (MOV tracker)
If not reached, and user wants to go on checkout, nudge to add items to basket to unlock free delivery
We could propose items which are in value range of missing amount or past ordered on quik/food
(soft, desert, snack)
- User should understand there is an exclusive offer available with Careem plus on this
merchant (type of offer, discount)
- User should be able to get more details about the offer if needed (time end, number of times)
tracker could be available if offer is valid for a number of time only
Unsubscribed user
- User should be able to understand there is a free delivery benefit with a merchant
- User should be able to understand what the MOV to avail free delivery with a merchant
- User should be nudged to add subscription to basket if MOV is reached
- User should understand there is an exclusive offer available with Careem plus on this
merchant (type of offer, discount)
- User should be able to get more details about the offer if needed (time end, number of times)
- User should be nudged to add subscription to basket if MOV is reached to avail free delivery +
exclusive offer
Maybe too extreme, but a nudge while pressing button to go on checkout to add subscription in 1
click to basket and avail free delivery + offer could be pretty powerful
“You’re 1 click away to save AED 30 and unlock free subscription”
Checkout - Customer problems
------
Context
The Food team is going to redesign the entire checkout experience, hence the need to re-think about
the ideal member and non member experience
------
Current experience
- Careem Plus users
- Free delivery applies automatically if order value is greater than AED 30
- We communicate to user if the benefit applies successfully or not (line item) if basket
is lower or greater than AED 30
- Careem Plus exclusive offer is available in selected restaurants and user has to apply
manually the existing promo code
- We communicate savings made overall on checkout (Careem Plus benefit + any other
benefit on top)
- Non Careem Plus users
- The new Careem Plus checkbox is available for all users on Careem Plus merchants
only to add subscription to Food basket
- Such experience includes a validation of payment method to allow user to add or not
the subscription (cash + partial payment not allowed)
- For selected eligible subscriptions, the checkbox is not showing but instead a Careem
Plus banner within order details (link to Careem Plus sign up). Those subscription are
mainly B2B / Bank offers as they require a BIN validation to successfully activate the
subscription which is not available with this feature
------
Problem statement: Careem Plus users
- Benefit application:
- The current method of notifying users about applied benefits is noticeable, but the
location may not be relevant, especially if the order is less than AED 30.
- We do not effectively communicate to users how the Minimum Order Value (MOV)
functions (based on Basket total or Order total), which could lead to confusion when
the MOV is not met.
- Exclusive offers application
- We fail to distinguish between Careem Plus exclusive offers and other existing offers
during checkout, potentially leading users to be unaware of exclusive offers available
to them.
- We do not automatically apply Careem Plus exclusive offers, which may result in
users failing to utilize relevant discounts from Careem Plus.
- We do not permit users to apply Careem Plus exclusive offers on top of any food offer,
which may not align with users' expectations (applying the Careem Plus offer
alongside any other offer, including the free delivery benefit).
- Gratification
- The combined approach we're showcasing today (offering free delivery along with
applying any food or Careem Plus promo code) may not accurately represent the true
value proposition of Careem Plus.
- The undifferentiated experience fails to cultivate the sense of "premium" value that
users anticipate when subscribing to the program.
- Self delivery merchants (Not part of Careem Plus)
- On the checkout page, we fail to provide clear communication regarding why Careem
Plus is not being applied, potentially causing confusion and undermining customer
trust in the program.
- Bank offers
- We don’t communicate well why the benefit doesn’t apply as card is not eligible on
checkout (apple pay not working / mixed payment not working as well)
------
Problem statement: Non Careem Plus users
- Benefit understanding
- We don’t clearly communicate to users the benefit won’t apply once adding the
subscription as MOV is not reached (limited to 2 line times in checkbox component)
- Benefit application
- User is not able to see the basket updated in Payment summary once adding the
subscription to basket as the whole section is hidden behind the sticky footer
- Limited payment method options
- The current experience to inform users the subscription cannot be added as the
payment method is not eligible is not clear enough and has been interpreted wrongly
by few tigers
Solution: Show the Careem Plus widget for cash users as well
- If payment method on file, you switch to this payment method automatically
- If no payment method on file, you follow new flow Proceed to payment where
user will be able to add payment method or block cash / nudge cplus go away)
- We don’t allow user to add subscription to their basket if they select a mix of wallet
and card/apple pay (see some sizing in ) PRD - Careem Plus x Flywheel
- Exclusive offers
- We don’t allow users to apply the Careem Plus exclusive offer when adding the
subscription to their basket which might cause potential confusion and undermine
customer trust in the program
We run some analysis on acquisition on checkbox from merchants offering exclusive
offers:
- 7.71% of the total acquisition from the Food checkbox were from Exclusive
merchants in January 2024
- 8.95% of the total acquisition from the Food checkbox were from Exclusive
merchants in February 2024 whereas Operation Falafel exclusive offer has
been switched off (#2 in January)
This definitely shows there is a solid potential to promote exclusive offers + free
delivery in 1 click. This is even more important as we plan to double on exclusive
offers in 2024
More details here: Food Checkbox x Exclusive Merchants
- The same limitation does exist for HALF3PLUS which we don’t show to non members
anymore. So ideally the same construct as above should be solved.
- As we plan to launch C+ Monday offers, we should be able to allow a non member to
add subscription and avail Monday offer at the same time.
- We should ensure C+ Monday offers savings as well are shared with Careem Plus
(new benefit and new system discount to be tagged as C+ Exclusive offer)
- Bank offers
- If a user is eligible to subscribe to a bank offer (12 months free with HSBC / 3 months
free with Arab Bank), we don’t allow user to add their subscription to the Food basket
as we don’t have the capability to validate the BIN
- We don’t promote to users available Bank offers they could avail by selecting a
different payment method and adding their subscription to Food basket
