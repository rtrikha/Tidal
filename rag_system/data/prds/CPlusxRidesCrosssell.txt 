Price awareness issue - Most users spoken to were unaware that
the price of the subscription was at 19AED. - Many users had skewed, higher
perceptions of the price which built an unwillingness to subscribe.
- The real price was a delighter, and a great motivator to subscribe.
People don’t want to calculate value - Users assessed the value of the
subscription with the amount of money they would be able to get back.
- Once the return on Rides was calculated with the users, they were pleased with the knowledge of their savings.
- Many users did not want to have to calculate this value, and would have appreciated it being done for them.
Breadth of CPlus benefits issue - Many users were unaware of the breadth of
services the Careem Plus subscription entailed. - Users had similar behaviours in other apps (the
likes of Food, Groceries, DineOut), but mentioned a willingness to try those services knowing they would have these benefits alongside their rides benefit.
- DineOut was particularly unknown, which is supported by results from our Brand Tracker analysis.
- While Quik is known as a service, the benefit remains less known.
Details of CPlus benefits issue - Not knowing the details of the benefits and
when they applied created a hesitation to subscribe.
- Communicating these details upfront may help to calm this, and and feelings of being ‘cheated’.
TLDR: Key Learnings
CPlus X Rides Cross-Sell
Key insights - Educate me
19AED is a game-changer. Let’s yell it.
"Is it really 19AED? I save much more on rides than 19AED - I thought it would be 75−100AED per month"
"19AED is on the lower end. I think I would definitely get value.”
"I think it's 200/300 every month"
"I would highlight the 19AED per month, that's a game changer for me"
"19? I didn’t know.. Now I would have liked to know that. 19 is nothing, especially for deliveries and rides as well"
Finding Most users were unaware of the price of Careem Plus. 5 out of 8 users expressed wanting to subscribe at the end of the interview, primarily because of the price realization. Some users had skewed perceptions of how much it costs from recall (49AED, 75−100AED, 200/300AED)
Implication There was a clear lack of awareness of the price of Careem Plus. It seemed to hugely affect willingness to subscribe. The skewed perceptions could possibly be a result of our communications. Highlighting the 19AED may help garner more interest to subscribe.

Users were unaware of, and appreciated, the breadth of benefits
Finding Customers were unaware of the breadth of services they could benefit from. The rides benefit alone was not necessarily enough to convince a user to subscribe, however, in tandem with the other benefits, Careem Plus was a lot more enticing. DineOut was largely unknown, but was a delighter once explained to the user. The food benefits were very attractive as well.
Implication We should work on selling not only the ride benefit, but Careem Plus as a whole, highlighting journey-related benefits (e.g. DineOut if the location is a restaurant, Food if it’s a work-to-home journey). It’s important to note that still being able to see that the user receives a rides benefit as well is also key.

Post-pickup BS is invasive… but a great educator
Finding The bottom-sheet was seen as annoying, and it wasn’t always clear how to exit the bottom-sheet. However, users received the most value, informatively, from this component. By being unable to exit immediately, this forced users to scan the information for a way out. Information on breadth of services and the price was communicated effectively - more work can be done on the depth of information.
Implication We can use this bottom-sheet as a way to educate our users as they learnt the most with this component. However, the inability to leave might border on being seen as ‘Dark UX’. A possible solution is a timed ‘Maybe later’ button, allowing users to have time to read but also be provided with a clear exit.

"I'm not going to do it right now because I want to know more"
Finding While users were pleased with the breadth of services they could benefit from, in some cases it was seen as ‘too good to be true’. People wanted to see the ‘catches’ (MOV, caps to discounts, T&Cs were commonly mentioned). Users were unwilling to commit to a subscription without knowing those details, they fear the limitations might make the subscription invaluable to them.
Implication We need to communicate the details of how the benefits can be applied up-front. Unless users are confident in knowing what they’re signing up for, they are hesitant to sign-up at all. A possible solution is to do this upon expanding the benefit tiles
"I would check it out first, read the terms and conditions before I sign up."
"I'm not gonna walk 25 minutes to find I can only use it on 2 dishes"
“maybe it will only let me use it on 3 or 4 dishes, I'd rather pay more and get exactly what I want"
"What are the terms and conditions? Is it only main course? What is it?"
"You would think unlimited delivery, so no minimum order"

Key insights -Make it easy for me
Users don’t want to calculate savings
Finding Users were hesitant to subscribe because they were unsure of the value they would receive. Value is primarily linked to the savings they would make through using Careem Plus. Upon calculating their potential savings with them, they were delighted, but noted that they wouldn’t go through the effort of doing it themselves. This was especially apparent in Hala users.
Implication Calculate the user’s savings for them, and take away that strain and extra effort on their behalf. Use this as key messaging, and make it personal. “Your rides last month could have saved X AED” is more powerful than “Users save upto X AED”.
“Oh, Mian, you did 10 rides. You could have saved this much. That would be nice"
Participant 8 (Hala User - 1−2× Savings)
“Don’t make me think" “I don’t wanna make a calculation”
Participant 2 (Hala User - 1−2× Savings)

Process of signing-up is a barrier
Finding The bottom-sheet was great as an educational piece, but users were in the middle of a task and didn’t want to stray from that (more on this on the next slide). They wouldn’t be willing to leave their task in order to sign-up, and it doesn’t help that they pre-conceived the process as a long one. More than one user mentioned “I don't want to have to give card details and all again”, and voiced “I might interact but depends if it just does it automatically.”
Implication Ensuring a quick, low-effort sign-up process would aid user willingness to engage with sign-up touchpoints. Communicating the ease of it would aid this as well as it relays how the interaction is taking away a barrier or strain.

Action is taken later
Finding As mentioned earlier, users were largely unwilling to leave their ride-booking process in order to subscribe. However, if they did express interest in Careem Plus, they would rather take the action after booking the ride.
Implication While the bottom-sheet after booking the ride is a good way to give users an opportunity to sign-up after booking, the users that participated were mostly not likely to be using their phones at this point. A reminder function, or highlighting an easy sign-up touchpoint somewhere else might help prompt users to complete the action after their ride.

Other insights
Captain is on the way > You’re on your way - if it’s seen
Finding Most users spoken to noted that they don’t interact with the Careem app after booking their ride, but if they do, it’s to check the Captain’s details when they are on their way. Most users will not open the Careem app again once they are in their ride.
Implication If we choose to use the bottom-sheet Post-Yalla, ‘Your Captain is on the way’ would be a more advantageous point than ‘You’re on your way’. Data suggests that ~40% of people do look at this screen, so that may suggest a likelihood of noticeability if not interaction. The fact that they are not actively booking, bodes well for likelihood of interaction.

‘Squidget’ goes unnoticed
Finding When going through the natural flow. No users made comments on the small pop-up ‘squidget’. The delay in the squidget appearance meant most did not even see it the first time as they would have already clicked to enter their destination. Upon going through it slowly, most users did not find it engaging or informative after drawing their attention to it
Implication The squidget acts as a good reminder later in the flow. Users did find it redundant after the large bottom-sheet however, and the research suggests a low likelihood of interaction with the squidget.

Other barriers to subscribing
Travel Some of our users travel for work. This can be for variable, sometimes unknown, lengths of time. This creates a hesitation to commit to something they can’t always use.
A ‘pause subscription’ feature or the ability to switch programs between KSA and Dubai/Abu Dhabi (for example), may help appease that.*
Inconsistent use of the app Some of our users use Careem more during some months than others. The inconsistency meant, while there may not be interest now, there may be ‘seasonal’ or ‘phased’ interest.
Reminders in anticipation of the end of their cycle may help users, but might not bode well for us. Emphasising the price and the range of the benefits may also aid in the user’s assessment of value.*
Driving/Drivers Some of our users have drivers or cars shard with the family. They might also be ready to drive soon, or are only temporarily using the app to account for car issues. In this case, the uncertainty of their future use of the app, creates the hesitation to subscribe.
Encouraging users to try other services, and find value in other parts of the subscription may help tend to their assessment of value.*
Dubai has you spoilt for choice Competition in Dubai is evident. There is an app for most things, and a lot of our users have behaviours in other apps that they are used to.
Highlighting how our subscription brings added and differentiated value from competition may help encourage users to switch behaviours.*

Conclusion & next steps

Conclusions
• Through this research, we have found that there is a clear lack
of awareness of the price of the subscription - that alone is a game-changer for willingness to subscribe.
• Users were not always aware of the breadth and depth of the benefits of Careem Plus. The breadth was a delighter, and not knowing the details build feelings of being ‘cheated’ and hesitation to subscribe.
• The bottom-sheet is a great educational piece. It’s a mid-booking pop-up however, so action is mostly only willing to be taken later. How and when we do this can be discussed.
• The anticipation of a long sign-up process is a barrier to subscribe. Easing this and communicating it may alleviate this hesitation.
• Users have dynamic lives, and how we alleviate the hesitations that arise from that should be discussed to encourage more sign-ups.

Next steps
• Conclude how we want to communicate the breadth of services and their details.
• Conclude how and when we show the different forms of content e.g. DineOut highlight, Rides highlight, Food highlight
• Discuss how and when we want to fulfill the sign-up action, knowing that it is unlikely to occur mid-booking.
• Conduct a workshop to explore how we might account for calming the hesitations from people’s dynamic lifestyles.
