Careem Plus: Add subscription on Ride
Last updated date 19.08.2025
Problem statement
The release of Flywheel 1.0 in December 2023 has been a successful milestone for Careem Plus and
Ride hailing teams with first customized experiences for non-members on ride. This has been
complemented further in December 2024 when we released improved customization (potential
savings), more seamless experience (bottom-sheet), and even aggressive new tactic (Intercept).
Those two milestones allowed us to significantly increase member penetration on ride from 12.5% in
October 2023 to 21.8% in June 2025 (on Hala, from 13% to 21.9%). Even if this is still a solid
achievement, we didn’t yet crack the huge opportunity on the ride hailing base. Hence, the clear
problem to solve: How might we increase Careem Plus penetration in the ride hailing base ? is the
natural continuity from the work done in the past.
Customer problem
- As a customer, I still don’t fully understand the benefits which I can unlock by subscribing to
Careem Plus
- As a product, with recent RUMI launch, we do believe we slightly degraded the experience as
we don’t communicate anymore potential savings through the ride booking funnel
- As a customer, I don’t want my journey to be interrupted before booking a ride, but still
interested by subscribing if there is a seamless option to do so
Hypothesis
We believe that building a seamless experience for ride users to easily subscribe to Careem Plus while
booking a ride will boost drastically Careem Plus conversion, and support membership penetration in
ride and Hala base in Dubai, and other regions then.
Strategic alignment
- Strategy:
- Be clearer about Careem Plus value proposition in the booking flow
- Offer a seamless experience to activate Careem Plus while booking a ride
- Complement with delightful gratification/unlock experiences
- Metric:
- Ride penetration: Tracking Careem Plus penetration on ride base
- Hala penetration: Tracking Careem Plus penetration on hala base
- % throughput: Tracking the conversion % of users eligible for new experience
- Tactics:
- Build new experiences on verify to communicate about Careem Plus
- Allow users to seamlessly add subscription to their current ride booking (Checkbox)
- Make sure users feel rewarded instantly when interacting with new experience
- Ensure users don’t drop subscription while booking a ride (regret experience)
- Sizing/Opportunity
- On daily basis approximately, 65k unique users booking a ride or hala in Dubai
- The Add to basket conversion rate on Food is around 1.65-1.8% (2024 data).
- Applying the same number is a daily acquisition of 1,170 customers. But conversion
should be less, we could keep 0.8%, this goes as 520/daily
- We should compare this with the current daily net on Ride, and keep the difference.
- Hypothesis is extra 220 (current would be around 200/day), so extra 2.6k

Product tactics
Strategy Details
Entry Point & Placement a. Booking Flow Injection: Show an “Add Careem Plus & save AED
X on this ride” banner right before ride confirmation (verify)
b. Price Comparison Nudge: Show two options:
i. “Confirm Ride: AED 40”
ii. “Confirm Ride with Plus: AED 19/month + AED 35
(today)” → Immediate savings is visible.
c. One-Tap Upgrade: Make it just a single tap to enable Plus and
complete payment with the ride.
Messaging & Value Props a. Instant Gratification: “Get AED X back on this ride if you join
now.”
b. Stacking Value: Highlight ride + future savings (e.g., “Save AED 5
now + up to AED 150 monthly on rides, food & more”).
c. Loss Aversion: “Without Plus, you’ll pay AED 40. With Plus, it’s
AED 35. Why pay more?”
Conversion tactics a. Auto-apply Trial: Default to a free trial if eligible (e.g., “Try Plus
free, save AED 5 instantly”).
b. Time-bound Nudge: “Available only for this ride – unlock Plus
now to save instantly.”
c. Social Proof: “Thousands of riders save on every trip with Plus.”
d. Cash bookings: Nudge users to switch / add digital payment
method and unlock extra incentive
Frictionless payment a. Single Checkout Flow: Combine ride payment + subscription
signup in one step.
b. Carrier Billing / Wallet Balance: Deduct subscription from the
same payment method as the ride for simplicity.
c. Grace Period Option: Allow subscription sign-up to be
retroactively applied if the payment fails (reduce drop-offs).
Post-Signup Delight
a. Instant Confirmation: Show “AED X saved on this ride thanks to
Plus.”
b. Personalized First Month Summary: Track and show value built
up (“You already saved AED 20 in your first 3 rides”).
c. Cross-Vertical Nudges: After ride, highlight food/grocery
benefits → expand habit quickly.
Risks & Guardrails a. Avoid Over-Nagging: Show this offer selectively (e.g., 1 out of 3
rides) to avoid banner blindness.
b. Transparent Cancellation: Make it clear “Cancel anytime before
renewal to avoid charge” → builds trust.
c. Fairness: Ensure existing Plus members aren’t confused by
seeing non-relevant prompts.
Edge cases a. Cancelation: In case of user canceling the ride, we should
inform user subscription will be canceled immediately and
benefit will not apply of course.
b. Ride payment failure: In case payment failed post ride
completion, we should cancel immediately subscription and
not give benefit. User to be informed and redirected to
Careem Plus sign up experience ?
Detailed Requirements for Engineering Teams (User Stories & Acceptance Criteria - MVP only
- If user is not subscribed to Careem Plus in a selected region, user should be eligible to add
subscription to their current booking
- User should be able to see a Add to Booking experience on Verify
- We should communicate to user Plus details on membership (trial + price) and benefit which
can be unlocked instant
- Once user adds membership to booking, user should get a confirmation message such as
Benefit is going to apply on this ride + membership will start on verify
- Once user added Careem Plus, member experience on verify to show
- If user is using selected payment method on this ride booking, experience to not show, and
we could show instead a nudge for user to switch
- Not in scope for MVP: Cash, Apple Pay
- If user selects a CCT not eligible, the experience should not show
- Once user pressing yallah with Plus added, user should see welcome experience while waiting
for the captain to be found
- Subscription will start and AED 1 charge/refund on pressing yallah, and ride payment will
happen when ride completed
- If a user cancels the ride or captain cancels the ride, user should be able to go back to verify
and the Plus experience should be auto-ticked
- If payment fails for that selected ride on which Plus has been unlocked, the benefit will still be
given, and membership should remain active. This will be an underpayment on Ride to be
solved
