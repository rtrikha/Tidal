Experiment Results UAE & Jordan | Auto-check applied on Food checkbox
UAE:
53.3% of the customers who were exposed to the checkbox in TG subscribed to Plus
Only 3.7% of the customers unchecked the box to exclude Plus activation
This behavior is expected due to 2 reasons: (1) It's a 60D trial, so customers don't see any increase in price on the basket value and hence lower resistance to convert, (2) The position of the checkbox is on the top, likely some customers not aware of how to uncheck and end up subscribing as soon as they subscribe.
Anticipated future impact that needs to be monitored for: (1) Increase in cancellation rate of these customers, (2) Decrease in M2 -> M3 retention, impacting Paid retention over time. -- Both metrics will be impacted in Nov '25 and Jan '26 respectively.
Immediate next step: As the objective here is to acquire all A/B customer segments on Plus, we'll scale this to 100% of A/B customer cohort and continue to acquire them.
Jordan:
14.4% of the customers who were exposed to the checkbox in TG subscribed to Plus
80.7% of the customers unchecked the box to exclude Plus activation --- this is primarily driven by the fact that there is 6 JOD increase in basket value immediately. -- This gives a good representation of the impact if we choose to auto-apply annual plan upgrades to existing users.
