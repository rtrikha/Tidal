communicating more vs a single number
“Gamify” the experience for a customer to unlock
value if signing-up to Careem Plus
Ensure customers can easily link such value missed to
their past activities
Invest into limited-time tactics to improve further
conversion
From Missed Savings to Must-Have: Cashback claim
Increase visibility of failed payments Strengthen communication to prompt timely action
Enable passive recovery mechanisms Apply controlled deterrents where necessary

Tactics
Show real-time payment failure notifications in-app
& via push/SMS
Integrate auto-deductions from
rides, food, and groceries for underpayments /

restrictions) for repeated failures
From Revenue Leakage to Smart Recovery
