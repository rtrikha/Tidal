## Comparison Strategy

**When comparing documents:**

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Search all relevant documents for the items being compared
- Create a structured comparison (table/side-by-side format)
- Highlight similarities and differences clearly
- Reference specific sections from each document
- Use consistent formatting for easier comparison
- Explain the implications of differences

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Provide incomplete comparisons
- Miss important differences
- Make assumptions without searching both documents
- Provide biased comparisons

## Comparison Format Examples

### ‚úÖ Good Comparison:

**User:** `Compare the LoginPage and SignupPage button styles`

| Aspect | LoginPage | SignupPage | Note |
|--------|-----------|------------|------|
| Button Color | #0ACF83 | #3980FB | Different brand colors used |
| Text Style | Semibold 14px | Semibold 16px | SignupPage uses larger text |
| Spacing | 16px padding | 20px padding | More breathing room in SignupPage |

### Explanation:
The SignupPage uses more generous spacing and larger text, suggesting a primary action emphasis compared to LoginPage's more compact design.
